### Features

* don't set $.fn.wire ([2b9e369](https://github.com/mu-lib/mu-jquery-wire/commit/2b9e369))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* From this version it's prefferred that users call wire
via `wire.call($element, attr, callback). Users who want the old behaviour
can use `$.fn.wire = require("mu-jquery-wire/jquery.wire");` or equivalent.



<a name="2.0.0"></a>
# [2.0.0](https://github.com/mu-lib/mu-jquery-wire/compare/v1.1.1...v2.0.0) (2016-09-02)


### Features

* callback should return instance not class ([c3c7b87](https://github.com/mu-lib/mu-jquery-wire/commit/c3c7b87))
* follow standard jQuery praxsis for 'this' ([42997c8](https://github.com/mu-lib/mu-jquery-wire/commit/42997c8))
* remove .find from $.fn.wire and instead rely on 'this' ([82d5f56](https://github.com/mu-lib/mu-jquery-wire/commit/82d5f56))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* Users have to $(element) on their own in callback.
* Callback now has to return an instance not a module.
* users will have to update their code to first select
elements. A simple way to do this is by adding .find('[attr_goes_here]')
right before the .wire call.
